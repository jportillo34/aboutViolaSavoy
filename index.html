    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This is a brief chronicle of little-known events in the life of Viola Savoy, an actress of theater plays and films. Today, there are several publications about the life and performances of the actress. However, many of these publications do not provide exact references and only refer to articles that also lack precise references. In this regard, and the reason for writing this work, was the opening of a gap that occurred just this year (2025). A couple of months ago I contacted <em>The Billy Rose Theatre Division of the NYPL</em> for information. A publication on <em>The Billboard</em> announced the death of Frank L. Sowars father of Viola Savoy and former performer<sup>[1]</sup>. This brief note was the starting point of the investigation that led to request and later consult the birth, death, and marriage records in Boston, MA and New York area.
    </p>
    <p>
      This year (2025) marks the anniversary of the <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> reels (1915). Let this short piece serve as a complement to the existing articles and information about the actress, as well as the theater and cinema scene in New York City during her era.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Though this research chronicles some Viola Savoy's contributions to early theater. There are more information about here on those records (marriage, etc.) but I do not consider it relevant. There remain many unanswered questions about her life after 1940. Key areas still requiring further investigation include her exact date of death (1987), the cause of her passing, and whether she had any relatives, besides her parents, in acting. Did she venture into talking pictures? Did she make any attempt at a career in Hollywood? These details are important to fully understanding the scope of her life and legacy. I encourage future researchers to take up these questions and continue to build on the findings presented here.

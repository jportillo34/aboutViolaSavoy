    <h2>Some notes on the life and work of actress Viola Savoy</h2>
    <h5>Research by Jose Portillo</h5>
    <p>
        This is a brief chronicle of little-known events in the life of Viola Savoy, an actress of theater plays 
        and films. Today, there are several publications about the life and performances of the actress. 
        However, many of these publications do not provide exact references and only refer to articles that 
        also lack precise references. In this regard, and the reason for writing this work, was the opening 
        of a gap that occurred just this year (2025). A little note on The Billboard announced the death 
        of Frank L. Sowars father of Viola Savoy and former performer. This brief note was the starting point 
        of an investigation that led to request and later consult the birth, death, and marriage records 
        in Boston, MA and New York area.
